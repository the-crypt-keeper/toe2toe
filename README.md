# Tic-Tac-Toe LLM Evaluation System

This project implements a system to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It provides a framework for testing and comparing different LLM-based players against an ideal player implementation.

## Project Structure

- `ttt_core.py`: Contains the core game logic, including the `TTTState` class which represents the game state.
- `ttt_players.py`: Defines player classes, including the `TTTPlayerIdeal` which implements an optimal strategy.
- (Future) LLM integration files for testing language models as Tic-Tac-Toe players.

## Features

- Tic-Tac-Toe game state management
- Ideal player implementation with optimal move selection
- (Planned) Integration with LLMs for player behavior
- (Planned) Evaluation metrics for comparing LLM performance against the ideal player

## Getting Started

(Add installation and setup instructions here once the project is more complete)

## Usage

(Add usage examples and instructions once the LLM integration is implemented)
